# BlackJack

## How To Play!

All commands are through the command line!

First, just enter your name for a nice greeting, and afterwards, all
you have to do is decide whether or not to hit or stand (quite literally
type in "hit" or "stand"), and from there the game will take care of the rest!

## Code Breakdown

Card.java = container class that'll help us compartmentalize values for the cards ~

Deck.java = the main class through which we manage the cards, shuffle the deck, and also draw a new card each time ~

Game.java = main file through which we'll be doing our work ~
